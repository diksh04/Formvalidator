<h3>Form validator</h3>

<p>Form validator is made using React Js which only allows users to submit forms when all fields are correctly filled else it will throw an error. It ensures data integrity by allowing users to submit the form only when all fields are correctly filled. If any required fields are incomplete or contain invalid data, the validator alerts the user and prevents form submission until corrections are made. This ensures that only accurate and complete information is submitted, enhancing the reliability and usability of the application. </p>
